      details:`A grid layout consists of a grid container and several grid items. The grid container must have its display property set to grid or inline-grid. grid creates a block-level container, and inline-grid creates an inline-level container.

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>
  <div class="item">3</div>
  <div class="item">4</div>
  <div class="item">5</div>
  <div class="item">6</div>
</div>
.container {
  display: grid;
}
All direct children of this container will automatically become grid items.

Grid columns
Visit Code Demo ðŸ”—

Hint: You can edit this CodePen demo directly.

You can then specify how many columns you wish to create using the grid-template-columns property. The property accepts any number of values. The number of values determines the number of columns, and the value itself determines the size of that column. For example:

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;
}
.item {
  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
  font-size: x-large;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid orange;
  background-color: bisque;

        <h2>Introduction to Next.js</h2>
        <p>Next.js has quickly become one of the most popular frameworks for building React applications. It provides a wealth of features right out of the box, including server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.</p>
        
        <h2>Performance Optimization Techniques</h2>
        <p>When building scalable applications, performance is a key concern. Next.js provides several features to help optimize your application:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic code splitting</li>
          <li>Image optimization with next/image</li>
          <li>Static site generation for faster page loads</li>
          <li>Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Deployment Strategies</h2>
        <p>Deploying a Next.js application can be done in several ways, depending on your specific needs:</p>
        <p>Vercel offers the simplest deployment experience, as it's built by the same team behind Next.js. However, you can also deploy to other platforms like Netlify, AWS, or a traditional server.</p>

        <h2>What is GraphQL?</h2>
        <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need, and nothing more.</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits Over REST</h2>
        <p>Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL APIs allow clients to request exactly the data they need, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching problems common with REST endpoints.</p>
        
        <h2>Setting Up a Basic GraphQL Server</h2>
        <p>Setting up a GraphQL server is straightforward with libraries like Apollo Server or Express GraphQL. You define a schema that specifies the types of data available and the queries clients can make.</p>
